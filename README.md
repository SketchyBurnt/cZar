### 			"cZar"			###

Overview:::
This Python program is a simple encoder/decoder that transforms messages based on a shift value and a password. It uses a Caesar cipher-like approach, combined with a password-derived shift, to disguise and later decode messages.

How It Works:
- Encoding: It asks for a password, a message to encode, and a shift value. It uses a combination of the password and shift to disguise the message, while preserving spaces and punctuation.
- Decoding: It asks for the password, the encoded message, and the shift value used during encoding. It then reveals the original message.
